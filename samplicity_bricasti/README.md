Samplicity’s highly acclaimed and free impulse responses from the Bricasti M7 reverb unit:

Samplicity – Bricasti IRs version 2023-10.zip (964 Mb)

The 2023-10 version contains fixes and is the result from re-processing, resulting in even better SNRs and frequency responses. These IR files are different from the content in current and upcoming Samplicity plugins.

Formats: True Stereo IR files in quad channel and double stereo Wave files, in 44.1 kHz and 48 kHz

These files can be used in convolution plugins that can read IR files in Wave format, for instance Apple Space Designer, Steinberg REVerence, LiquidSonics Reverberate and Audioease Altiverb.
